/* Write a program that implements a guessing game.  The computer should pick a random integer in the range [-10,10].  It should then take guesses from the user (using Scanner and the nextInt() method -- provided in the starter code) until the value guessed by the user is within 2 of the randomly selected integer.  A congratulatory message shoild be displayed and the randomly selected integer and the final guess should be displayed.
